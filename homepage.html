            <p>Like McConnell or not, the entire article is a blatant partisan attack. It blames McConnell for the current state our country. Nevermind the fact we are in the middle of a pandemic that <a href="https://www.pogo.org/analysis/2020/05/the-first-100-days-of-the-u-s-governments-covid-19-response/" target="_blank"> neither Republicans or Democrats took seriously until February</a>, a whole month after it was reported to be in the United States. Or that Democrats also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcconnell-calls-for-covid-19-aid-bill-excluding-liability-shield-state-aid-11607457672?mod=politics_lead_pos3" target="_blank"> haven’t agreed to any version of this COVID relief bill either</a>. No, McConnell is the devil! The best part of this is that the article states “this is not mere partisan hyperbole.” Sure buddy, whatever you say.</p>
            <p>  <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/judge-take-final-shots-trump-flynn-he-agrees-dismiss-case-n1250415" target="_blank"> "Judge take final shots at Trump, Flynn as he agrees to dismiss case" </a> </p>
            <p>Despite his role as a judge to remain impartial until all facts are presented in court, the judge that presided over Flynn’s case said Trump should not have pardoned him. This is also the same judge that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-seeks-time-to-consider-motion-to-dismiss-michael-flynn-case-11591043624?mod=searchresults_pos4&page=1" target="_blank">refused to drop the case</a> when the prosecutors wanted to. In the last paragraph, he cites past Supreme Court decisions to say that “acceptance of a pardon implies an admission of guilt”. In my research, I only found one Supreme Court case pertaining to pardons. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/236/79" target="_blank">Burdick v. United States (1915)</a> said that the receiver of a pardon has the right to reject the pardon. It says nothing about a pardon being an admission of guilt.</p>

            <p>Steve Hilton reports that making people wear masks is “pseudoscientific nonsense”. Multiple studies have been done on this subject early in the year, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html" target="_blank">most notable from the CDC</a>, that show masks work to stop the spread of COVID-19. Hilton also goes on to compare wearing masks to people dying during lockdown. Wow, it’s almost like people would die if they didn’t wear masks!</p>
            <p> <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/12/08/woke-olympics-breakdancing-added-to-2024-paris-games/" target="_blank"> "Woke Olympics: Breakdancing Added to 2024 Paris Games" </a> </p>
            <p>BrietBart calls breakdancing “woke”. Not entirely sure why. Breakdancing has been around since the 70s and is very popular today. They also report that the new additions, including ensuring the 2024 event will have equal male and female participation, is a “means to an end to … political neutrality” for the Olympics. Again, not sure what part of this is political.</p>

            <p>Apparently, being pro-choice is now a radical agenda. The article reports on House Democrats’ hearing on repealing the Hyde Amendment. This <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/142" target="_blank">amendment</a> prohibits the federal government from using taxpayer money to fund abortions. This is not extreme or radical especially since we have Medicare and Medicaid, both of which are healthcare-related programs.</p>
