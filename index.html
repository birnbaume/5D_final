            <p class="ex">Like McConnell or not, the entire article is a blatant partisan attack. It blames McConnell for the current state our country. Nevermind the fact we are in the middle of a pandemic that <a href="https://www.pogo.org/analysis/2020/05/the-first-100-days-of-the-u-s-governments-covid-19-response/"> neither Republicans or Democrats took seriously until February</a>, a whole month after it was reported to be in the United States. Or that Democrats also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcconnell-calls-for-covid-19-aid-bill-excluding-liability-shield-state-aid-11607457672?mod=politics_lead_pos3"> haven’t agreed to any version of this COVID relief bill either</a>. No, McConnell is the devil! The best part of this is that the article states “this is not mere partisan hyperbole.” Sure buddy, whatever you say.</p>
            
            <h3>  <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/judge-take-final-shots-trump-flynn-he-agrees-dismiss-case-n1250415" target="_blank" class="article"> "Judge take final shots at Trump, Flynn as he agrees to dismiss case" </a> </h3>
            <p class="ex">Despite his role as a judge to remain impartial until all facts are presented in court, the judge that presided over Flynn’s case said Trump should not have pardoned him. This is also the same judge that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-seeks-time-to-consider-motion-to-dismiss-michael-flynn-case-11591043624?mod=searchresults_pos4&page=1">refused to drop the case</a> when the prosecutors wanted to. In the last paragraph, he cites past Supreme Court decisions to say that “acceptance of a pardon implies an admission of guilt”. In my research, I only found one Supreme Court case pertaining to pardons. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/236/79">Burdick v. United States (1915)</a> said that the receiver of a pardon has the right to reject the pardon. It says nothing about a pardon being an admission of guilt.</p>
            
            <h3> <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/israeli-palestinian-conflict-complex-court-case-shows-nation-state-law-n1249778" class="article"
            target="_blank">"The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is complex. A court case shows the 'nation state' law isn't.""</a> </h3>
            <p class="ex">To start, the ’nation state’ law is one of the Basic Laws of Israel (outline rights of individuals and principles of the state to substitute the lack of a formal constitution). It reaffirms Israel as a State for the Jewish people. It affirms Hebrew as the national language and declares national holidays on Shabbat and the Jewish holidays. It does not, however, declare Judaism as the official religion unlike the rest of the Middle East and lots of European countries. Second, this is a controversial law in and outside of Israel. One of the main criticisms is that some don’t want Israel to be a place only for Jews; they want to include everyone. This article completely disregards the historical implications of the law and the reasons for enacting it. This law in no way say Arabs living in Israel have to leave or are unwelcome. At the end of the article, the author says the problems that have arisen as a result of this law are comparable to our long history of race relations in America. He even said it was the equivalent of “separate but equal”. It is not. For a complete (and amazing) breakdown of the law and its implications, read <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/understanding-israel-s-nation-state-law">Understanding Israel’s Nation State Law</a>  from the Jewish Virtual Library.</p>
            <h3> <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/watch/steve-schmidt-we-are-one-election-away-from-losing-our-democracy-97429061803" target="_blank" class="article">"Steve Schmidt: We are ‘one election away… from losing our democracy’"</a> </h3> 
            <p class="ex">As we are all aware, Trump refuses to accept the election results. He has even taken it to the Supreme Court. This video says this behavior is one example of the imminent “collapse of the Republican party” for their blatant disregard for how our democracy works. Although, I plead you, dear reader, not to forget the countless other Democrats who have refused to accept their election results either and are still calling ‘voter suppression’ without any real evidence. First, we have Stacey Abrams who was running for the governor of Georgia in 2018. She and other prominent Democrats <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/beto-orourke-stacey-abrams-rigged-election">still say the election was rigged</a>. We also have Andrew Gillium also running for governor in 2018 in Florida. Kamala Harris has said that <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-voter-suppression-abrams-gillum-1415903">both of these candidates would have won if it wasn’t for voter suppression</a>. Last but certainly not least, we have Hillary Clinton and the 2016 presidential election. For the past 4 years, she and countless other Democrats have spoken out and said that the
            <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/hillary-clintons-bad-habit-of-questioning-election-results-has-spread-to-all-democrats/">election was rigged</a>. So please, next time someone says this is the collapse of democracy or any other BS, think of this blurb.

            <p class="ex">Steve Hilton reports that making people wear masks is “pseudoscientific nonsense”. Multiple studies have been done on this subject early in the year, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html">most notable from the CDC</a>, that show masks work to stop the spread of COVID-19. Hilton also goes on to compare wearing masks to people dying during lockdown. Wow, it’s almost like people would die if they didn’t wear masks!</p>

            <p class="ex">BrietBart calls breakdancing “woke”. Not entirely sure why. Breakdancing has been around since the 70s and is very popular today. They also report that the new additions, including ensuring the 2024 event will have equal male and female participation, is a “means to an end to … political neutrality” for the Olympics. Again, not sure what part of this is political.</p>

            <p class="ex">Apparently, being pro-choice is now a radical agenda. The article reports on House Democrats’ hearing on repealing the Hyde Amendment. This <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/142">amendment</a> prohibits the federal government from using taxpayer money to fund abortions. This is not extreme or radical especially since we have Medicare and Medicaid, both of which are healthcare-related programs.</p>

            <p class="ex">This article refers to Sen. Swalwell, who was confirmed to have been in contact with a Chinese spy 6 years ago. It quotes House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy questioning if House Majority Leader Pelosi knew about that spy and if it impacted any decisions she made in office. The piece only quotes Republicans and only shares their opinion on the issue. There is no opinion quoted from Democrats and the information is presented as fact rather than opinion.</p>
